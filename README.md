<h1 align="center">Creating a simple neural network from scratch</h1>

## Description
This is the first part of a series of projects that will eventually end in a self made library to build neural networks with a variety of layers so that I will be able to have a neural network that solves MNIST or even more complicated problems. But first I start at the very beginning, a single layer linear neural network that solves a simple classification problem.
